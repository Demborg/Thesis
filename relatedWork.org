Since their introduction Convolutional Neural Networks[[bibentry:lecun1998gradient]] have driven the state of the art for computer vision systems.

# Nått om reduced bit representation

It was shown in[[bibentry:denil2013predicting]] that neural networks typically contain a lot of redundant parameters and that up to 95% of parameters could be predicted from the remaining 5% without any drop in accuracy. Since then there have been several attempts to try and remove this redundancy.
