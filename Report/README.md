# kththesis
This is the LaTeX class for Bachelor and MSc theses at KTH. The guidelines are defined here:
https://intra.kth.se/en/administration/kommunikation/mallar/avhandlingarochexamensarbeten

The class does not define a cover page which is handled by KTH Library separately, instead it creates a flyleaf page with title, author, supervisor and examiner. The package contains example on how to use the class.

TODO:
* implement support for Licentiate and PhD theses
